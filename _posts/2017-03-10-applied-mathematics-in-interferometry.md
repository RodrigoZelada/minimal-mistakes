Interferometry it's a Astronomic Resolution technique that uses many antennas together, which produces better precision and allow to analyze data in radar wavelength.
The resolution doesn't depend on antennas diameter, inded it depends of separation: while antennas further between them, greater it's the interferometer resolution, so images are more detailed. <strong>ALMA</strong> (<i>Atacama Large Milimiter Array</i>) it's a revolutionary interferometer, due to his 66 antennes between 6 and 12 meters.
We will review briefly the <strong>Maximimum Entropy Method</strong> (<i>MEM</i>) and also study the relationship between spectrum and frequency.
